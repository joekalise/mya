description: >-
  Drive the full internationalization journey for a project — detect the stack,
  recommend a library, set up the chosen library, wrap existing strings, and
  connect a translation platform (Globalize.now, default-on). Use when the user asks to add or
  configure i18n, internationalization, localization, multi-language support,
  or translations — including when they explicitly mention LinguiJS, Lingui,
  next-intl, "wrap strings", "find hardcoded text", "make my app translatable",
  or "set up translations". Triggers on generic phrasings like "add i18n",
  "internationalize my app", "add translations", "multi-language support",
  "localize my app", and on library-specific phrasings like "set up Lingui",
  "set up next-intl", "use Lingui in this project". Does not trigger for
  unrelated CSS-only RTL questions (those use css-i18n) or for managing an
  already-set-up Globalize.now project (those use globalize-now-cli-use).

# i18n Orchestrator

This skill drives the full i18n journey through five stages:

| Stage | Goal |
|---|---|
| 1 — Inspect and decide | Detect stack, ask all user questions, generate an executable plan |
| 1.5 — Globalize account (upfront) | Install CLI + sign in + verify org via `globalize-now-account-setup` |
| 2 — Setup | Install + configure the chosen library |
| 3 — Convert | Wrap hardcoded strings, extract + compile catalogs |
| 4 — Globalize project (end) | Create project + connect repo + set patterns via `globalize-now-project-setup` |

Stages 1.5 and 4 only run when the user keeps Globalize connection in scope (default-on; see 1.6). The Globalize work is split deliberately: account creation is interactive and project-independent, so it runs **upfront** while the user is engaged; project + repo setup needs the converted catalog paths, so it runs at the **end**.

The orchestrator (this SKILL.md) is library-agnostic. Library- and stack-specific guidance lives in `references/` and is loaded by subagents at dispatch time, driven by `manifest.json`.

**Architectural rule:** the orchestrator never executes work directly. It asks Phase 1 questions, generates the plan, dispatches subagents in the background, polls a shared progress workspace at `.globalize/`, and surfaces results. All file modifications, all bash commands, and all reference reading happen inside subagents. **One carve-out:** the interactive Globalize steps (account sign-in in 1.5, project + repo connection in Phase 4) run on the main thread by **delegating to the `globalize-now-account-setup` / `globalize-now-project-setup` skills via the Skill tool** — the orchestrator never inlines Globalize CLI commands itself (those skills own the authoritative command surface).

---

## Workspace: `.globalize/`

Created in the **target project root** (the project being internationalized). Every artifact the orchestrator and subagents share lives here.

```
.globalize/
  detection.json              # output of inspect subagent (Phase 1.1)
  decisions.md                # frozen user choices from Phase 1
  plan.md                     # executable plan for phases 1.5/2/3/4
  manifest-snapshot.json      # frozen copy of the chosen manifest entry
  globalize-inputs.json       # resolved Globalize project inputs (written in Phase 4, read by globalize-now-project-setup)
  progress/
    setup.json                # Phase 2 setup subagent
    wrap-1.json…wrap-N.json   # Phase 3 wrap subagents (one per partition)
    verify.json               # Phase 3 verify subagent
    archive/<ISO-timestamp>/  # archived after each phase completes
```

### First-run setup

If `.globalize/` does not exist in the target project, create it and append `/.globalize/` to the project's `.gitignore` (create the file if missing). Confirm with the user only if `.gitignore` exists and already has rules — show the diff before appending.

> **User-facing message** (when actually creating the folder):
> "Created `.globalize/` in your project root and added it to `.gitignore`. This folder holds local progress files, decisions, and plans so we can resume mid-run and so you can audit what was decided. It stays out of git."

> The project's **own** generated i18n artifacts (Lingui's compiled catalogs, Paraglide's `outdir`) are a separate concern, ignored later inside Phase 2's `gitignore_artifacts` step (see §2.2) — the orchestrator never writes those rules itself.

### Resumability

If `.globalize/` exists when the orchestrator starts, read `plan.md` and `progress/*.json` to determine state. If a plan is already in flight (some phases incomplete), tell the user:

> "Found an in-progress i18n setup at `.globalize/`. Last completed step: `<step>`. Want me to resume from there, or start over with a fresh plan?"

Proceed accordingly.

**Globalize auth is global, not local.** Sign-in state lives in `~/.globalize/config.json` (or the `GLOBALIZE_API_KEY` env var), **not** in `.globalize/`, so never infer the account step's done-ness from a local marker — it may have been configured outside this run. On resume, just re-delegate: both Globalize skills are idempotent. The account skill self-skips when `auth status` already returns valid credentials; the project skill lists-before-creates (`projects list`, `github installations`, existing repo connections), so re-invoking it fast-paths whatever is already done. That idempotency is why Phase 4 needs no `progress/globalize.json`.

---

## Phase 1 — Inspect and Decide

Phase 1 ends with a fully populated `.globalize/` (detection, decisions, plan, manifest snapshot) and the user's "go" before any work happens. Every decision this skill collects lives in Phase 1 — Phases 1.5/2/3/4 are execution (the two Globalize stages delegate their own sign-in / browser interaction to the `globalize-now-account-setup` / `globalize-now-project-setup` skills).

> **User-facing message** (orchestrator kickoff, before 1.1):
> "Hey — I'll walk you through internationalizing this project: inspect the stack, sign in to Globalize, set up the library, wrap your hardcoded strings, and finally create your Globalize project + connect the repo. First I'll do a read-only scan of your project — framework, router, existing i18n setup, files with translatable text. No changes yet. After that I'll ask a small set of questions to shape the plan (including whether to connect Globalize — it's on by default, and you can opt out)."

### 1.1 Inspect subagent

Dispatch a subagent (foreground, blocking — small output, no progress polling needed) with this prompt:

> You are inspecting a project to gather i18n setup context. Read-only — do not modify any files.
>
> First decide the project **language**, applying these rules **in order, first match wins** (the order is load-bearing — a root `package.json` must beat native signals so hybrid/web wrappers route to JS):
> 1. A `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock` (containing `rails`), `bin/rails`, or `config/application.rb` is present → **ruby** (read the Ruby signals below instead of the JS ones).
> 2. A root `package.json` is present → **js-ts** (read the JS signals; this deliberately includes hybrid/web-wrapper apps — **React Native, Capacitor, Cordova, Ionic** — which ship a native `android/` or `ios/` folder but localize in the JS layer, so they belong on the JS path or its §1.2 stop, never a native path).
> 3. Native-Android Gradle signals are present (`AndroidManifest.xml`, OR a `build.gradle`/`build.gradle.kts` applying `com.android.application`/`com.android.library`, plus `gradlew`/`settings.gradle`) **AND** there is no root `package.json` **AND** no `pubspec.yaml` → **android** (read the Android signals below). (A `pubspec.yaml` means Flutter — it ships an `android/` Gradle subfolder but localizes via `.arb`, not native `strings.xml`; it is excluded here and stopped in §1.2.)
> 4. `*.xcodeproj`/`*.xcworkspace`/`Package.swift`/`*.swift` is present (and none of the above matched) → **swift** (read the Swift/Apple signals table below).
> 5. Otherwise → **unknown**.
>
> For a **js-ts** project, read the project's `package.json`, build config files (`vite.config.*`, `next.config.*`, `.babelrc`), and survey the source tree. Output **only** a single JSON object matching this schema, written to `.globalize/detection.json`:

> | Field | How to detect |
> |---|---|
> | `language` | Apply in order (first match wins): (1) `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock` (containing `rails`), `bin/rails`, or `config/application.rb` → `ruby`. (2) root `package.json` present → `js-ts` (this beats native signals on purpose, so RN/Capacitor/Cordova/Ionic hybrids route to JS). (3) native-Android Gradle signals (`AndroidManifest.xml`, or `build.gradle{,.kts}` applying `com.android.application`/`com.android.library`, plus `gradlew`/`settings.gradle`) AND no root `package.json` AND no `pubspec.yaml` → `android`. (4) `*.xcodeproj`/`*.xcworkspace`/`Package.swift`/`*.swift` present (none of the above) → `swift` (read the Swift/Apple detection rules below, not these). (5) none → `unknown`. (The JS-path rules below apply only when `language === "js-ts"`; the Ruby table only when `language === "ruby"`; the Android table only when `language === "android"`; the Swift/Apple table only when `language === "swift"`.) |
> | `framework` | Evaluate in this order, first match wins: `next` in deps → next. `nuxt` in deps → nuxt. `quasar` in deps → quasar. `@tanstack/react-start` in deps → tanstack-start. Any `@remix-run/*` runtime package in deps → remix. `react-router` in deps AND `@react-router/dev` in devDeps AND a `react-router.config.{ts,js}` file at the repo root → react-router-framework. `@sveltejs/kit` in deps or devDeps → sveltekit. `vite` in devDeps (and none of the above) → vite. `react-scripts` in deps → cra. (Order matters: Remix v2, React Router v7 framework mode, and SvelteKit all ship `vite` in devDeps, so they must be checked before the `vite` fallback. React Router v7 SPA mode — `react-router` without `@react-router/dev` — correctly falls through to `vite` with `router: "react-router"`.) |
> | `router` | App Router: `app/` or `src/app/` with `layout.tsx`/`layout.js`. Pages Router: `pages/` with `_app.tsx`/`_app.jsx`. TanStack Start: deps include `@tanstack/react-start`. TanStack Router (client): `@tanstack/react-router` without `react-start`. React Router: `react-router` in deps (also the value reported for `framework: "remix"` and `framework: "react-router-framework"`, since both use react-router internally; this is informational only, no matcher predicates on it for those frameworks). Vue Router: `vue-router` in deps (Vite SPA / Quasar). SvelteKit: `framework === "sveltekit"` — file-based routing under `src/routes/`. |
> | `compiler` | `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` → swc. `@vitejs/plugin-react` (no `-swc`) → babel. Next.js → swc unless `.babelrc` exists. TanStack Start → swc if `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` (or `@vitejs/plugin-react@6+`) is in devDeps; babel otherwise. Remix v2 and React Router v7 framework mode → swc if `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` is in devDeps; babel otherwise (both default to Babel via `@vitejs/plugin-react`). SvelteKit uses neither — the Svelte compiler runs through Vite (esbuild), and none of the rules above match — so the field is a don't-care for SvelteKit; report whatever the heuristic yields (it will not match any rule) and treat the value as not meaningful: the SvelteKit manifest entry does not key on `compiler`. |
> | `react` | `react` in deps or devDeps. |
> | `vue` | `vue` in deps or devDeps. |
> | `svelte` | `svelte` in deps or devDeps. |

> | `routeEntries` | App Router: `<root>/src/app/**/page.tsx`. TanStack file-based: `<root>/src/routes/**/*.tsx`. Remix v2 or React Router v7 framework mode: `<root>/app/routes/**/*.{tsx,jsx,ts,js}`. SvelteKit: `<root>/src/routes/**/*.svelte`. None if no file-based routing detected. |
> | `existing.library` | First match in deps/devDeps from the union of i18n libraries listed above. |
> | `existing.configured` | `lingui.config.*` present AND macro plugin wired in build config; OR `next-intl` config present AND plugin wired; OR (Vue) `createI18n(` present in `src/i18n/index.*` (Vite/Quasar) or `defineI18nConfig(` in `i18n.config.*` (Nuxt) AND `messageCompiler` wired; OR (Paraglide) `project.inlang/settings.json` present AND `paraglideVitePlugin` in `vite.config.*`. |

> | `existing.catalogsScaffolded` | Locale directories with at least one message file exist. |
> | `existing.stringsWrapped` | Glob source tree (`.{tsx,jsx,js,svelte}`), sample up to 50 files, count files with bare markup text vs. files importing macros/message functions (for Paraglide, `import { m } from '$lib/paraglide/messages.js'`): > 80% imported → "yes", > 20% → "partial", else → "no". |
> | `candidateFiles` | Glob `src/**/*.{tsx,ts,jsx,js,svelte}`, exclude tests/configs/`.d.ts`, grep each for: bare markup text (`>Word<`, including Svelte template text), user-visible attrs (`placeholder=`, `aria-label=`, `title=`, `alt=`), exported user-facing string literals, **and display-copy string literals inside exported data/content modules** — string *values* under object/array keys whose name matches `name`, `title`, `label`, `heading`, `subheading`, `description`, `summary`, `body`, `text`, `message`, `caption`, `placeholder`, `tooltip`, `alt`, `cta`, or `content` (e.g. `export const products = [{ name: '…', description: '…' }]`). Deliberately narrow — do **not** treat identifier/config keys as display copy (`id`, `slug`, `sku`, `key`, `href`, `src`, `type`, `variant`, `icon`, `role`, `className`, `testid`); those are covered by the `code.md` skip-list and must not inflate the candidate set. This is a recall signal: a data module matching it becomes a wrap candidate so a Phase 3 subagent opens it; the subagent still applies the skip-list, so occasional over-match is harmless. Return files with ≥1 match, sorted by match count desc. |
> | `localeSignals` | List existing locale dirs (e.g., `src/locales/`), env vars matching `*LOCALE*`, README mentions of language names. |
>
> **Ruby / Rails detection rules** (apply only when `language === "ruby"`; the JS rules above do not apply):
>
> | Field | How to detect |
> |---|---|
> | `framework` | `rails` gem in `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock`, OR `bin/rails`, OR `config/application.rb` → `rails`. Otherwise `unknown` (non-Rails Ruby — Sinatra, Hanami, plain `i18n` gem — is not supported; see 1.2). |
> | `packageManager` | `bundler` (Rails projects use Bundler + `Gemfile`). |
> | `version` | Parse `Gemfile.lock`: the line `rails (N.M.x)` → extract `N.M` (e.g. `"8.1"`). Used for the soft EOL warning in 1.2 and the `rails-i18n` pin. `null` if not resolvable. |
> | `router` | `none` (Rails routing is not modeled here; the `version` field is what the Rails path keys on). |
> | `existing.library` | `rails-i18n` in `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock` → `rails-i18n`; else `none`. (Rails' built-in `I18n` API is always present; `rails-i18n` adds CLDR plural data.) |
> | `existing.configured` | `config.i18n.*` keys (e.g. `default_locale`, `available_locales`) set in `config/application.rb` or a `config/initializers/*.rb`. |
> | `existing.providerWired` | An `around_action`/`switch_locale` or `I18n.with_locale` locale switcher present in `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`. |
> | `existing.catalogsScaffolded` | `config/locales/*.{yml,rb}` present with at least one populated, non-stub locale file (note split layouts — `devise.en.yml`, nested dirs — all auto-loaded by Rails). |
> | `existing.stringsWrapped` | Glob `app/views/**/*.erb`, `app/controllers/**/*.rb`, sample up to 50 files, count files using `t(`/`l(` helpers vs. files with bare user-visible text: > 80% using helpers → "yes", > 20% → "partial", else → "no". |
> | `candidateFiles` | Glob `app/views/**/*.erb`, `app/controllers/**/*.rb`, `app/mailers/**/*.rb`, `app/models/**/*.rb`; grep for bare user-visible text and string literals not already wrapped in `t(`/`l(`. Return files with ≥1 match, sorted by match count desc. |
> | `localeSignals` | List `config/locales/` files and the locale codes present; `config.i18n.default_locale`/`available_locales` values; README mentions of language names. |
>
> **Name-collision guardrail (Ruby):** the gems `globalize`, `mobility`, and `traco` translate **DB/model content** (per-row data like a product's `name`), NOT UI strings, and are entirely **unrelated to Globalize.now**. Do **not** treat `globalize` (the gem) as the Globalize.now platform. If any is present in `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock`, record it in `localeSignals.readmeHints` (or a free-form note) as a detect-and-warn signal — it must never trigger UI-string i18n logic and is surfaced to the user in 1.2 but is non-blocking.
>
> **Android detection rules** (apply only when `language === "android"`; the JS and Ruby rules above do not apply). "Module `res/` root" means the main module's resource dir — default to `app/src/main/res` (note multi-module/flavor layouts: `feature/src/main/res`, `src/<flavor>/res` — surface them in `localeSignals` but target the app module in v1):
>
> | Field | How to detect |
> |---|---|
> | `framework` | `android` (native Android — Gradle + `AndroidManifest.xml`). |
> | `packageManager` | `gradle`. |
> | `version` | `null` — Android emits no version-gated i18n code (string resources are stable across all API levels), so no version is captured. |
> | `router` | `none` (Android routing is not modeled here). |
> | `existing.library` | `android-strings` if `<module>/res/values/strings.xml` exists; else `none`. (String resources are platform-built-in — there is no library to depend on.) |
> | `existing.configured` | At least one target resource dir `<module>/res/values-*/strings.xml` exists (a locale overlay is present). |
> | `existing.providerWired` | A locale-selection mechanism is wired: `AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales(` in source, OR `android:localeConfig` in `AndroidManifest.xml` with a `res/xml/locales_config.xml`. (Optional — per-app language is an add-on; `false` is normal.) |
> | `existing.catalogsScaffolded` | `<module>/res/values/strings.xml` (the source catalog) exists. |
> | `existing.stringsWrapped` | Sample up to 50 files across `<module>/res/layout/**/*.xml` and `**/*.{kt,java}`; count files referencing resources (`@string/`, `getString(`, `getText(`, `stringResource(`, `pluralStringResource(`) vs. files with bare user-visible literals: > 80% referencing → "yes", > 20% → "partial", else → "no". |
> | `candidateFiles` | Glob `<module>/res/layout/**/*.xml`, `<module>/res/menu/**/*.xml`, `<module>/res/xml/**/*.xml` (grep bare `android:text="literal"`, `android:hint=`, `android:title=`, `android:contentDescription=` with a non-`@string/` value), plus `**/*.{kt,java}` (string literals passed to `setText(`, `Text(`, `Toast`, etc., not already `getString`/`stringResource`). Return files with ≥1 match, sorted by match count desc. |
> | `localeSignals` | Locale codes parsed from `<module>/res/values-*/` dir qualifiers — normalize both legacy (`values-pt-rBR`) and BCP47 (`values-b+sr+Latn`) forms to BCP47; note any non-app-module `res/` dirs; README mentions of language names. |

> |---|---|
> | `language` | `*.xcodeproj`/`*.xcworkspace`, `Package.swift`, or `*.swift` present → `swift`. (Only reached when there is no Gemfile-rails, no root `package.json`, and no native-Android Gradle signals — a root `package.json` routes React Native / Capacitor / Flutter to `js-ts` first.) |
> | `framework` / `router` / `compiler` / `react` / `vue` / `svelte` / `typescript` | Not meaningful for native Apple — set `framework: "unknown"`, `router: "none"`, and leave `compiler`/`react`/`vue`/`svelte` as `null`/`false`. No iOS manifest variant keys on any of them (iOS variants key on `language`/`buildSystem`/`platform`/`uiFramework`). |
> | `buildSystem` | `Package.swift` present and NO `.xcodeproj`/`.xcworkspace` → `spm`. `.xcodeproj`/`.xcworkspace` present → `xcode`. |
> | `uiFramework` | The `@main` entry point decides: a file with `import SwiftUI` + a `struct …: App` + `@main` → `swiftui` (even if it also uses a `UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor`). `@UIApplicationMain`/AppDelegate/SceneDelegate (a type conforming to `UIApplicationDelegate`/`UIResponder`) and/or `.storyboard`/`.xib` files with no SwiftUI `App` → `uikit`. Genuine ambiguity → default `swiftui`. An SPM library with no app entry point → `null`. NEVER emit `"mixed"` (it is unroutable). |

### 1.2 Apply compatibility hard-stops

Read `detection.json`. Apply these rules top-to-bottom. If any matches, **STOP** the orchestrator with the corresponding message — do not proceed to 1.3.

**Evaluate first (signal stops):** the three Android signal-stops in the "Android compatibility rules" block below — **React Native**, **Capacitor/Cordova/Ionic**, and **Flutter** — are checked **before** the generic rows in the table that follows, so a hybrid or Flutter project receives its specific, actionable message rather than the generic "React/Vue/Svelte only" stop (which would otherwise pre-empt it for a hybrid app that has no React/Vue/Svelte dependency).

When stopping, prefix the message with `Compatibility check — found a blocker:` so the user sees a clear framing rather than an abrupt error.

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `language === "ruby"` AND `framework !== "rails"` | **STOP.** "globalize-guide currently supports Ruby only through Rails (built-in `I18n` API + locale-rooted YAML). Non-Rails Ruby (Sinatra, Hanami, plain `i18n` gem) is not supported. Point me at a Rails app, or use the `i18n` gem docs directly." |
| `gettext_i18n_rails` OR `fast_gettext` in `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock` | **STOP.** "This project uses `gettext_i18n_rails` — the catalog format is PO, not YAML.

It translates DB/model content (per-row data), not UI strings, and is unrelated to Globalize.now. The i18n setup won't touch it, and its content won't be in the connected catalog. Proceeding with UI-string i18n." Never conflate the `globalize` gem with the Globalize.now platform.

**Soft EOL warning (Ruby, non-blocking — NO emission gating):** if `language === "ruby"` AND the detected Rails `version` is `7.1` or earlier: "This project is on Rails {version}, which reached end-of-life. The Rails path supports 6.1 → 8.1 at the same code level (no version-gated i18n branches) — the emitted code is identical — but running EOL Rails in production isn't recommended. Consider upgrading. Proceeding." The default target is Rails 8.1; support runs down to 6.1. There is **no** version-gated emission for Rails (clean contrast with the JS framework version branches above).

**Android compatibility rules.** The first three rows fire on **signals** (deps / files), independent of the detected `language` — the §1.1 rule already routes hybrid and Flutter projects away from `language: "android"`, so these stops exist to give the user a clear, specific reason rather than a generic "no manifest entry matches":

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `react-native` in `package.json` AND an `android/` folder present | **STOP.** "This is a React Native app. React Native localizes through JS i18n libraries (i18next, react-intl, Lingui), not native Android string resources. Native `android-strings` support targets native Kotlin/Java apps. Use the JS path, or wait for RN support." |
| `@capacitor/core`, `cordova`, or any `@ionic/*` in `package.json` AND an `android/` folder present | **STOP.** "This looks like a Capacitor/Cordova/Ionic hybrid app — its UI is localized in the web layer, not in native `strings.xml`. Run globalize-guide against the web UI (the JS path)." |

**No EOL / version warning for Android** (clean contrast with the JS framework version branches and the Rails soft-EOL note): string resources are stable across all API levels, so there is no version to warn about and no version-gated emission. The only API-gated features — the `b+` qualifier dir form (API 24+) and per-app language (API 33+) — are optional add-ons, never required.

These are not hard-stops, but note for the Paraglide path:

- If `existing.library === "paraglide"` AND `existing.configured === true`, do **not** run a from-scratch setup — route Phase 2 to the collapse / already-configured case (see "Phase 2 collapse-case").
- If `@inlang/paraglide-sveltekit` (the Paraglide 1.x SvelteKit adapter) is in deps, this is a **migration**, not a fresh setup: Paraglide 2.x replaced the dedicated adapter with the framework-agnostic `reroute` + `handle` model. Flag it to the user before proceeding; the setup reference covers the migration steps.

**Swift / Apple (iOS) compatibility rules** (apply only when `language === "swift"`; the two flipped JS rows above are exempted for Swift via their `language === "js-ts"` guard):

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `language === "swift"` AND a `.xcstrings` cannot be created and none exists (legacy `.strings`-only on a pre-Xcode-15 toolchain with no migration path) | **Note (non-blocking where possible).** Offer the **Edit ▸ Convert to String Catalog** migration; only STOP if there is genuinely no path to a catalog. |
| `language === "swift"` AND a non-iOS Apple target out of v1 scope (macOS/watchOS/tvOS) with no iOS app and no Swift package | **STOP (scope).** "v1 of the iOS String Catalog path targets iOS apps and Swift packages. {platform} is out of scope — the shared catalog mechanics may still apply manually." |

### 1.3 Resolve supported stacks from manifest

Read `manifest.json`. Filter `stacks[]` entries whose `match` predicate is satisfied by `detection`. The result is the set of `(library, variant)` options the user can choose from in 1.5.

**Matcher predicate (load-bearing).** A `match` object mixes two kinds of keys, handled differently — every `match` key names a same-named `detection` field **except `library`**, which has no detection counterpart:

- **Structural keys** — `framework`, `router`, `compiler`, and any other detection-state key an entry declares — must each equal the same-named field in `detection`. (Example: `nextjs-app-router-*` entries declare `framework: "next"`, `router: "app"`.)
- **`language`** is structural but special-cased:
  - If `match.language` is **present**, it must equal `detection.language` (so `rails-yaml`, which declares `match.language: "ruby"`, matches **only** when `detection.language === "ruby"`).
  - If `match.language` is **absent**, treat it as `"js-ts"` — i.e. the entry matches only when `detection.language === "js-ts"`. All existing JS entries omit `language`, so they keep matching exactly as before and are inert for Ruby projects.
- **`library`** is **not** a structural predicate. It is the **identifier of the variant/option** the entry offers — surfaced as a choice in §1.5. It is **never** matched against `detection.existing.library` (there is no top-level `detection.library`). `detection.existing.library` describes prior setup state and is used only by the §1.2 stops and the §1.6 / Phase 2 already-configured handling — it never filters the candidate set. This is why two entries can share identical structural keys and differ only in `library` (e.g. `nextjs-app-router-lingui` and `nextjs-app-router-next-intl`, both `framework: "next", router: "app"`): a fresh Next app-router project (`existing.library: "none"`) matches **both**, and the {lingui, next-intl} pair is surfaced as the §1.5 choice.
- **`platform`, `buildSystem`, `uiFramework`** are ordinary **structural keys** (each must equal the same-named `detection` field) that discriminate *among* the iOS variants — NOT a new special-cased matcher axis (only `language`'s absent⇒`js-ts` default is special). A `match.language: "swift"` matches only `detection.language === "swift"`, keeping the Swift, JS, and Ruby entry sets disjoint. No matcher-logic change beyond treating these three as plain structural keys.

This keeps the Ruby and JS entry sets disjoint by `language`: a Ruby detection can match only `rails-yaml`; a `js-ts` detection can match only the JS entries (never `rails-yaml`); a `swift` detection can match only the iOS variants.

**Hand-trace (iOS).** A `{swift, xcode, ios, swiftui}` detection selects **only** `ios-swiftui-string-catalog`: `ios-uikit-string-catalog` fails on `uiFramework` (uikit≠swiftui), `ios-spm-string-catalog` fails on `buildSystem` (spm≠xcode), every JS entry fails on absent⇒`js-ts` (≠swift), `rails-yaml` fails on `language` (ruby≠swift), and `android-strings` fails on `language` (android≠swift). A `{swift, spm}` detection (buildSystem `spm`, no app entry point) selects **only** `ios-spm-string-catalog`: the two app variants fail on `buildSystem` (xcode≠spm).

**Net effect.** A fresh Next app-router project yields **{lingui, next-intl}** candidates → §1.5 offers the choice. A fresh Rails project (`existing.library: "none"`) yields exactly **{rails-yaml}** → §1.5 confirms "Rails built-in I18n (YAML)". A fresh native-Android project yields exactly **{android-strings}** (its `match.language: "android"` requires `detection.language === "android"`) → §1.5 confirms "Android string resources (XML)". A fresh iOS project yields exactly **one** iOS variant → §1.5 confirms it (no multi-option prompt). A fresh `js-ts` detection never yields `rails-yaml`, `android-strings`, or an iOS variant (their `match.language` is `ruby`/`android`/`swift`, which fail).

If the filtered list is empty, surface a STOP with: "Your stack is supported in principle but no manifest entry currently matches. Detected: {summary}. File an issue or pick a different setup."

### 1.4 Branch recommendation

If `git.isRepo === true` AND `git.branch` is one of `main`, `master`, `develop`:

> You're on `{branch}`. Setup will modify several files, so I'd recommend a dedicated branch — easier to review or revert later:
> ```
> git checkout -b chore/i18n-setup
> ```
> Want me to create this branch when Phase 2 starts, stay on `{branch}`, or use a different name? (No git commands run yet — just answering the question.)

Record the answer in `decisions`.

### 1.5 Library choice

> **User-facing message** (before showing options):
> "Picking the i18n library. Based on **{framework}** + **{router}**, my recommendation is **{recommended-library}** — {one-line rationale from the table below}. You can override if you have a strong preference."

Show the user the list of supported variants from 1.3, with the recommendation marked. Recommendation rules (apply first match):

| Detection | Recommendation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `framework === "next"` | **next-intl** | Purpose-built for Next.js; first-class App Router (RSC + middleware) and Pages Router support. Uses ICU MessageFormat. No compile step. |
| `framework === "next"` AND user wants compile-time extraction | **Lingui** (alternative) | Compile-time macros, zero-runtime-overhead translations. |
| `framework === "nuxt"` | **vue-i18n via @nuxtjs/i18n** | The Nuxt module wraps vue-i18n with SSR-aware routing, lazy-loaded locale catalogs, and locale meta via `useLocaleHead`. The canonical Nuxt choice. |
| `framework === "quasar"` OR (`vue === true` AND `framework === "vite"`) | **vue-i18n** | The official Intlify library and de-facto standard across Vue 3 projects. Composition API + ICU via custom `messageCompiler`. |
| `framework === "remix"` | **Lingui** | Remix v2 (≥ 2.7, Vite-based) ships with no first-party i18n primitive. Lingui plugs in via `@lingui/vite-plugin`, gives compile-time extraction, and aligns with Remix's per-route `loader` pattern (dynamic catalog import per route). |
| `framework === "react-router-framework"` | **Lingui** | React Router v7 framework mode is the same shape: Vite + `loader` + root `<html>` rendering. Lingui's per-route catalogs map cleanly onto the routes config. |
| `framework === "sveltekit"` | **Paraglide JS** | First-party Svelte CLI add-on (`sv add paraglide`); compiler-based with tree-shaken messages; SSR-correct via AsyncLocalStorage; integrates through `reroute` + `handle` hooks. |
| `framework === "rails"` | **Rails built-in I18n (YAML)** | Rails ships a full `I18n` stack (`t`/`l` helpers, locale-rooted YAML at `config/locales/`, `%{name}` interpolation, CLDR plurals via `rails-i18n`); no third-party UI-string library needed. |
| `framework === "android"` | **Android string resources (XML)** | Android ships localization built in — `res/values/strings.xml` + `values-<qualifier>` overlays, `getString`/`stringResource` accessors, positional `%1$s` args, native `<plurals>` (CLDR categories). No third-party library to install. |
| `language === "swift"` | **Apple String Catalog (built-in)** | Apple ships a full localization stack (String Catalogs, `String(localized:)`/`Text` literals, `.stringsdict`/`variations` plurals via CLDR) built into the SDK — no third-party library or install needed. |
| anything else (vite + react, tanstack-start, etc.) | **Lingui** | The only library with reference support for non-Next.js React stacks today. |

Use AskUserQuestion if multiple variants apply. If only one variant matches, surface the choice as confirmation rather than a multi-option prompt. For `language === "swift"` exactly one iOS variant matches (see §1.3 hand-trace), so the choice is surfaced as a **confirmation** of the Apple String Catalog, not a multi-option prompt. The iOS variants are `supportLevel: "experimental"` — when confirming, tell the user so: e.g. "Setting up the Apple String Catalog path (built into the SDK — no install). Heads up: iOS/`.xcstrings` support is **experimental** — the live Globalize.now round-trip for this format hasn't been verified end-to-end yet, so double-check the Phase-4 connection."

### 1.6 Journey scope

> **User-facing message** (before asking):
> "Which parts do you want to run? I've pre-checked the ones that make sense given what's already in the project. Connecting **Globalize.now** to translate your catalogs is included by default — you can uncheck it to skip the platform."

Ask which parts to run. Defaults derived from `existing`:

- If `existing.configured === false` → setup is suggested
- If `existing.stringsWrapped !== "yes"` AND `candidateFiles.length > 0` → convert is suggested
- **Connecting Globalize is default-on — pre-check it.** The user can uncheck to decline the platform; only then do stages 1.5 and 4 get skipped.

Use AskUserQuestion with three multi-select options (setup / convert / connect translation platform) and the inferred defaults pre-checked — including `connect translation platform`. Record the result under `decisions.scope` (`decisions.scope.globalize` is `true` unless the user unchecked it).

### 1.7 Setup choices

> **User-facing message** (before asking):
> "A few setup details. Locales drive which catalog folders we scaffold and which CLI flags we pass; the routing strategy determines how locale shows up in URLs; setup mode is just how chatty I should be while running Phase 2."

If `setup` is in scope, collect:

- **Setup mode** — guided (per-step explanations, consent gates on file modifications) vs. unguided (run end-to-end, summarize at end)
- **Source locale** — default to `localeSignals` first existing or `en`
- **Target locales** — multi-input. Suggest from `localeSignals.existingLocaleDirs` and README hints
- **Routing strategy** — for JS/TS stacks, only if file-based routing is detected; ask: prefix-based (`/en/...`) or domain-based or none. **For Rails** (`language === "ruby"`): Rails detection sets `router: "none"`, so the file-based gate would skip this question — ask it explicitly here instead. URL-locale routing embeds the locale in the path (`scope "/:locale"`, e.g. `/en/books`) and edits `config/routes.rb` + adds `ApplicationController#default_url_options`. Ask: URL-locale routing (prefix `/:locale`) or none. Unguided default = **included** (the Rails Guide's recommended locale-persistence approach). Record under `decisions.setup` so `rails.setup.md` Step 5 reads the decision instead of silently applying its own default.
- **Catalog format** *(Paraglide only)* — defaults to **PO (gettext)** and **do not ask** for a fresh setup. PO is the default because a `.po` catalog carries `#.` translator comments that flow to the Globalize platform (the single biggest quality lever for AI translation), which the ICU-JSON model cannot. Set `decisions.setup.catalogFormat = "po"` silently. The **only** time to surface a choice is an **already-configured** Paraglide project on ICU-JSON (existing `messages/*.json` + `@inlang/plugin-icu1`): ask whether to **convert to PO** (recommended — a lossless migration, since both formats use ICU bodies; see "Phase 2 collapse-case" → migration) or **keep ICU-JSON** (`catalogFormat = "json"`). Omit entirely for non-Paraglide libraries.

Record under `decisions.setup`.

### 1.8 Convert choices

> **User-facing message** (before asking):
> "What's this app about? One-sentence answer is fine. I'll pass it to the wrapping workers in Phase 3 so the translator comments they add have the right context (e.g., '[Cart]', '[Onboarding tooltip]')."

If `convert` is in scope, ask the user to confirm the **app domain**. Infer from `package.json` description, README, route names, or component names. Default suggestion + freeform override.

The domain string flows into wrap-subagent prompts so they write better translator comments. For Paraglide on the default **PO** catalog format, `.po` entries carry `#.` translator comments, so the domain informs comments **and** key naming, exactly as for Lingui/next-intl. For Paraglide on the **ICU-JSON** catalog format (`decisions.setup.catalogFormat === "json"`, which has no translator-comment field), the app domain instead informs *key naming* only — it helps the wrap subagent choose descriptive, context-encoding keys (e.g. `cart_remove_button`), the only disambiguation lever available there.

### 1.9 Globalize-now choices

> **User-facing message** (before asking):
> "Translation-platform setup uses Globalize.now. I just need a project name and which git provider hosts your repo — both have sensible defaults from your `package.json` and git remote."

If `connect translation platform` is in scope, collect:

- **Project name** — default = repo name (from `package.json`).
- **Repo provider** — auto-detect from `git.remote` (github.com → GitHub, gitlab.com → GitLab); confirm.

### 1.10 Optional steps

> **User-facing message** (before asking):
> "Optional add-ons. None of these are required, but the passive coding rules (an `@import` line in your `CLAUDE.md`) are recommended — they keep me from re-introducing hardcoded strings on future edits."

Multi-select for setup-time optionals: ESLint plugin, CI/CD integration (extract+compile in build), test setup wrapper, install passive coding rules (`@import` line in target `CLAUDE.md`).

### 1.11 Generate `plan.md` + `manifest-snapshot.json` + `decisions.md`

> **User-facing message** (before writing):
> "Got everything I need. Writing your plan to `.globalize/plan.md` and your choices to `.globalize/decisions.md` so this run is auditable and resumable."

Write the three artifacts to `.globalize/`. See "Plan and decisions formats" below for shape.

Copy the chosen manifest entry verbatim to `.globalize/manifest-snapshot.json` so subsequent runs and subagents read a stable snapshot, not the live manifest.

### 1.12 Render plan + final go

Show `plan.md` to the user as a checklist. Ask:

> "Here's the plan. Ready to execute? (**yes** / **cancel** / **edit**)
> Once you say yes, I won't pause for more questions unless a subagent gets stuck or finishes a phase."

Cancel writes nothing further. Edit re-enters the relevant 1.x step. Yes proceeds to Phase 1.5 (when Globalize is in scope) or otherwise straight to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 1.5 — Globalize account (upfront, interactive)

**Gate:** run this stage only if `decisions.scope.globalize === true`. If the user unchecked Globalize at 1.6, skip 1.5 **and** Phase 4 entirely and go to Phase 2.

This stage gets the user signed in to Globalize **before** any code changes, so the platform is ready the moment the catalogs are done. It is the one interactive Globalize step that has nothing to wait for — account creation needs no project data — so doing it now keeps the long Phase 2/3 work hands-off.

> **User-facing message** (at stage start):
> "Before we touch your code, let's get you signed in to Globalize so it's ready when your catalogs are done. A browser window may open for device-flow sign-in. (Heads up: near the very end, when we connect your repo, you'll do one quick browser approval to authorize Globalize's GitHub/GitLab app — I'll remind you then.)"

**Delegate to the account skill (main thread).** Invoke the **`globalize-now-account-setup`** skill via the Skill tool. It runs install → sign-in → verify on the main thread (interactive device flow), and **self-skips the login** if `auth status` already reports valid credentials. Do **not** inline any CLI commands here — the skill owns them.

When it completes, record the authenticated org under `decisions.md` → `## Globalize-now` → `Authenticated org` (a soft audit marker), and mark `delegate_account_setup` done in `plan.md`.

**If `globalize-now-account-setup` is not installed** (globalize-guide installed on its own), the Skill invocation fails. Tell the user:

> "I couldn't load the `globalize-now-account-setup` skill — install the Globalize skills with `npx skills add globalize-now/globalize-skills`, then I'll continue." (The standard install co-installs all of them, so this is rare.)

**If the user cancels sign-in** (declines the browser step even though Globalize is in scope): don't block the run. Continue to Phase 2, and set a soft flag so Phase 4's `auth status` re-check re-offers account setup before the project step.

---

## Phase 2 — Setup

Single setup subagent. Orchestrator installs packages on the main thread first, then pre-creates the progress file and dispatches the subagent in the background.

> **User-facing message** (at Phase 2 start):
> "Starting Phase 2 — setup. {for JS/TS: `First I'll install the i18n packages on my main thread so your lockfile stays in sync, then I'll dispatch one background worker that wires your build config, sets up the provider, scaffolds catalog folders for your locales, and verifies with a typecheck and build.`; for Rails: `I'll dispatch one background worker that installs the i18n gems with Bundler, wires `config/application.rb`, scaffolds `config/locales/` for your locales, sets up the locale switcher in `ApplicationController`, and verifies by booting the app and parsing the source catalog.`; for Android: `Nothing to install — string resources are built into the platform. I'll dispatch one background worker that creates `res/values/strings.xml` as your source catalog, scaffolds `res/values-<qualifier>/strings.xml` for your target locales, optionally wires per-app language selection, and verifies by parsing the catalogs (and running Lint if the Android SDK is available).`; for Swift: `No packages to install — Apple's localization stack ships with the SDK. I'll dispatch one background worker that creates the String Catalog (`Localizable.xcstrings`), enables build-time string extraction (`SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS`), registers your locales, and verifies the catalog is valid.`} I'll show progress as a checklist that updates every ~30 seconds. If the worker hits something it can't decide on its own, it'll pause and ask."

### 2.0 Install packages (main thread)

Read `manifest-snapshot.json`'s `packages.runtime` and `packages.dev`. Run the install commands in the foreground using the package manager from `detection.json`. Stream output to the user.

> **Lingui (v6+) requires Node ≥ 22.19 or ≥ 24** — it ships ESM-only and fails to load on older Node. If the resolved stack installs `@lingui/*`, check the project's Node version (`node -v`, plus any `.nvmrc` / `engines` field) before installing. If it's older, tell the user and pause rather than installing a runtime they can't run.

| Package manager | Runtime command | Dev command |
|---|---|---|
| `npm` | `npm install <pkgs>` | `npm install -D <pkgs>` |
| `yarn` | `yarn add <pkgs>` | `yarn add -D <pkgs>` |
| `pnpm` | `pnpm add <pkgs>` | `pnpm add -D <pkgs>` |
| `bun` | `bun add <pkgs>` | `bun add -D <pkgs>` |

**Wrap each `<pkgs>` entry in single quotes** when constructing the shell command — the manifest pins use `^` (e.g. `next-intl@^4`), and zsh interprets unquoted `^` as a glob negation operator under `EXTENDED_GLOB` (common on macOS via oh-my-zsh). Emit `npm install 'next-intl@^4'` rather than `npm install next-intl@^4`. The single quotes are inert under bash/dash and prevent zsh expansion.

Skip the runtime or dev command if its package list is empty. For `packageManager === "bundler"` (Rails), both package lists are empty by design — gem installation is delegated to the setup subagent via `rails.setup.md` Step 2 (`bundle install`); the §2.0 install step is intentionally a no-op for Rails, not an error. For `packageManager === "gradle"` (Android), both lists are also empty by design — string resources are platform-built-in, so there is **nothing to install**; the §2.0 step is a no-op for Android too. For `language === "swift"` both package lists are likewise empty by design (native localization ships with the SDK — there is no third-party package to install), so §2.0 is a no-op for Swift too, not an error. If the install command fails (network error, registry rejection, lockfile conflict), stop the run with the error — do not advance to 2.1.

Running on the main thread keeps the install outside the subagent sandbox, so the user's lockfile stays in sync. The setup subagent in 2.2 will not re-install these packages.

> **User-facing message** (before running):
> "Installing the i18n packages on my main thread first so your lockfile stays in sync — I'll run `{install command}` and stream the output."

### 2.1 Pre-create progress file

```json
{
  "subagentId": "setup", "phase": 2, "status": "pending",
  "plan": [...steps from plan.md...],
  "completed": [], "current": null,
  "startedAt": null, "updatedAt": "<now>"
}
```

### 2.2 Dispatch setup subagent (background)

Subagent prompt skeleton:

> You are executing Phase 2 (Setup) of an i18n journey. Read `.globalize/decisions.md`, `.globalize/detection.json`, `.globalize/plan.md`, and `.globalize/manifest-snapshot.json` for full context.

> - Coding rules to install (if applicable): {manifest-snapshot.references.code joined}
>
> **Packages already installed.** The orchestrator ran the package install on the main thread (Phase 2.0) for the manifest's `packages.runtime` and `packages.dev` before dispatching you. Do **not** run `npm install` / `yarn add` / `pnpm add` / `bun add` for those packages. If a reference's setup instructions list an install command for them, treat it as already done and move on. Only flag an extra install if the reference explicitly calls for a package that is **not** in the manifest's `packages` (e.g., a pinned remediation version after a build failure or an opt-in extra) — in that case, write `status: "needs_decision"` with a `needsDecision: { step: "extra_install", question: "An extra package install is needed: <command>. Run it on the main thread?", options: ["yes", "skip"] }` and exit so the orchestrator runs it on the main thread.
>
> **Generated catalog artifacts must be gitignored (step `gitignore_artifacts`).** Compiled/generated catalogs are build output, not source. Append the pattern block from your setup reference's `` `.gitignore` `` section to the project's root `.gitignore` (create the file if missing). Consent follows the same rule as the workspace entry (see "Workspace → First-run setup"): append directly when `.gitignore` is absent or empty, otherwise show the diff before appending. **Never ignore the catalog *sources*** — the `.po` files (and `messages/*.json` for Paraglide ICU-JSON) are what Globalize imports from the repo in Phase 4. Wherever compiled output shares a directory with sources (every Lingui layout), the patterns must be **extension-scoped, never directory-scoped**, and must never use `messages.*`. If compiled catalogs are **already tracked** (a re-run, or an already-configured project), `.gitignore` alone will not untrack them: surface `git rm --cached <paths>` (files stay on disk) and run it only with the user's consent. Skip this step entirely for runtime-catalog libraries (next-intl, vue-i18n, Rails, Android, iOS) — they emit nothing to ignore.
>
> **Progress reporting:** After each step transition, atomically update `.globalize/progress/setup.json` (write `<file>.tmp` then `mv`). Set `status: "running"` on first update; populate `completed`, `current`, `currentDetail`, `filesCreated`, `filesModified`, `updatedAt`.
>
> **Ambiguity protocol:** If you hit a case the references don't cover (e.g., two layout files, custom config shape), do NOT improvise. Write `status: "needs_decision"` with a `needsDecision: { step, question, options }` object and exit. The orchestrator will ask the user and re-dispatch you.
>
> **Verification:** After all steps, run the project's typecheck (`tsc --noEmit` if TypeScript) and build command. Capture pass/fail in `result.verificationResult`. Set `status: "succeeded"` or `"failed"` accordingly.
>
> **Rails (`language === "ruby"` / `framework === "rails"`):** Rails has no typecheck and no build step, so instead run a **boot/smoke** check that proves the app boots and the i18n stack loads. Run `bin/rails runner 'I18n.t("site.title", default: "ok"); puts "i18n ok"'` (or `bin/rails about` as a lighter boot probe) and confirm it exits 0 and prints `i18n ok`. Then confirm the source-locale catalog parses: load `config/locales/{default_locale}.yml` and verify it is valid YAML (a malformed catalog is a setup failure). Map the result into the existing `verificationResult` shape: set the JS-only `typecheck` and `build` fields to `null` (not applicable to Rails), and record the boot/smoke pass/fail and YAML-parse pass/fail. Set `status: "succeeded"` only if both the boot/smoke and the catalog parse pass; otherwise `"failed"`.
>
> **Android (`language === "android"` / `framework === "android"`):** Android has no typecheck and the full Gradle build needs the Android SDK, so verification has two tiers and **degrades gracefully**: (1) **Always** parse every `res/values/strings.xml` and `res/values-*/strings.xml` for XML well-formedness (a malformed resource file is a setup failure) and confirm a target dir exists for each configured locale. (2) **If the Android SDK + Gradle are available** (`./gradlew` present and `ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` set, or `local.properties` has `sdk.dir`), run `./gradlew lint` and capture the `MissingTranslation` / `ExtraTranslation` results; if the SDK is absent, **skip the Gradle step, do not fail**, and record that lint was skipped for lack of a toolchain. Map into `verificationResult`: set the JS-only `typecheck` and `build` fields to `null`; record the XML-parse pass/fail and the lint result (or `"skipped: no Android SDK"`). Set `status: "succeeded"` if the XML parses and covers every locale (and lint is clean when it ran); otherwise `"failed"`.
>
> **Swift / Apple (`language === "swift"`):** Swift/Apple has no `tsc` and no JS build step, so instead run a **catalog-integrity check** using the headless `xcstringstool` three-step form (NOT a pipe):
> ```
> DIR=$(mktemp -d)
> xcrun xcstringstool extract <sources> --SwiftUI --modern-localizable-strings [--legacy-localizable-strings] --output-directory "$DIR"
> xcrun xcstringstool sync <catalog> --stringsdata "$DIR"/*.stringsdata
> xcrun xcstringstool print <catalog>
> ```
> This confirms the catalog is valid JSON and covers the used keys. Map into the existing `verificationResult` shape: set the JS-only `typecheck` and `build` fields to `null` (not applicable to Swift), and record the catalog-integrity pass/fail. **Graceful degradation:** if `xcrun xcstringstool` is absent (no Xcode toolchain — e.g. a non-Apple CI machine), author + static-JSON-validate the catalog instead (parse the `.xcstrings` as JSON; check it has `sourceLanguage`, `strings`, and `version`) and mark build-verify **deferred** (NOT failed) — the build-time `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS = YES` extraction (or a later `xcstringstool` run on macOS) will populate it. Set `status: "succeeded"` if the catalog-integrity check passes (or static-JSON-validate passes with build-verify deferred); `"failed"` only on a genuine integrity failure.

### 2.3 Poll progress

While `progress/setup.json` is in `running` state, wake every 30–60 seconds, read the file, update the user-visible todo list (one todo per `plan` step), and surface `currentDetail` as a transient status hint.

### 2.4 On completion

- `succeeded` → archive `progress/setup.json` to `progress/archive/<timestamp>/setup.json`, render summary (files created, files modified, verification result), advance to Phase 3. User-facing wrap-up:
  > "Setup verified — {for JS/TS: `typecheck and build are clean`; for Rails: `the app boots and the i18n config loads`; for Android: `the string resources parse and cover every locale (Lint clean)` or, when the SDK was absent, `the string resources parse and cover every locale (Lint skipped — no Android SDK)`; for Swift: `the String Catalog is valid and registered`}. Files created: {N}, files modified: {M}. Moving on to Phase 3 — wrapping your hardcoded strings."
- `failed` → archive, render error, ask user how to proceed (retry, edit plan, abort). User-facing wrap-up:
  > "Setup hit an error during `{step}`: {one-line error summary}. Want me to retry, edit the plan, or stop here?"
- `needs_decision` → surface the question to the user, capture answer, append to `decisions.md`, re-dispatch the same subagent (it reads existing `progress/setup.json` and resumes from `completed`). User-facing framing:
  > "The setup worker paused — it needs you to decide on `{question}`. Once you answer I'll send it back to finish from where it left off."

### Phase 2 collapse-case

If `existing.configured === true`, `plan.md` reduces Phase 2 to a verify-and-complete plan (verify what exists, add only what's missing — no from-scratch `create_config`): `verify_config`, `verify_provider`, `add_missing_locale_dirs`, a library-appropriate catalog step, `gitignore_artifacts`, and `build_verification`. The catalog step follows the variant's catalog workflow (see its `references.setup`): a **compile-time** library (Lingui) re-runs `extract_compile` to regenerate runtime catalogs from source; a **runtime-catalog** library (next-intl, vue-i18n; **Rails** — loads `config/locales/*.yml` directly at runtime; and **Android** — the platform loads `res/values*/strings.xml` at runtime) loads message files directly with no compile step, so the step is `verify_catalogs` — confirm the existing catalog files parse and cover every locale (for Rails, also run `bundle exec i18n-tasks missing -t used` to confirm every used key has a source-locale entry — not `health`, which false-fails on incomplete target stubs; for Android, confirm every `res/values-*/strings.xml` is well-formed XML and covers the source keys, running `./gradlew lint` for `MissingTranslation` when the SDK is available); a **compile-from-catalog** library (Paraglide) re-runs `paraglide_compile` (`npx '@inlang/paraglide-js@^2' compile --project ./project.inlang --outdir ./src/lib/paraglide`) to regenerate `src/lib/paraglide/` from the hand-authored `messages/{locale}.{json,po}` catalogs. Same dispatch pattern.

`gitignore_artifacts` runs in the collapse case too, and it is the **only** place the step can find pre-existing *tracked* generated catalogs: an already-configured Lingui or Paraglide project almost always has them committed. There the step does two things — append the ignore rule, and (with the user's consent) `git rm --cached` the tracked generated files so the working tree keeps them while git stops seeing them. Omit the step for runtime-catalog libraries, which generate nothing.

**Paraglide ICU-JSON → PO migration collapse-case.** If `existing.library === "paraglide"`, `existing.configured === true`, the project currently has `messages/*.json` (ICU-JSON / `@inlang/plugin-icu1`), and the user chose `decisions.setup.catalogFormat === "po"`, Phase 2 is a **format migration**, not a from-scratch setup. The plan steps are: `migrate_settings` (swap the icu1 module + key for the PO module + `plugin.globalizeNow.po` with `"messageFormat": "icu"`), `migrate_catalogs` (rewrite each `messages/{locale}.json` → `messages/{locale}.po` — lossless: `"key": "ICU body"` → `msgid "key"` / `msgstr "ICU body"`, carrying interpolation/plural/select verbatim; add the `msgid ""` header block; delete the old `.json`), `paraglide_compile`, and `build_verification`. The migration is driven by the **Migration: existing ICU-JSON → PO** section of `references/languages/js-ts/frameworks/sveltekit/paraglide.setup.md` (the default PO setup file). The per-file `migrate_catalogs` rewrite is independent across locales, so dispatch it as parallel background subagents (one per `messages/{locale}.json`). After migrating, run the plural-render check from that file's **Verify** step — a missing `"messageFormat": "icu"` or a botched ICU escape fails **silently** (renders raw ICU), so the build passing is not sufficient.

## Phase 3 — Convert

Multiple wrap subagents in parallel, then one verify subagent.

> **User-facing message** (at Phase 3 start):
> "Starting Phase 3 — converting hardcoded strings. I'm splitting **{file count}** files across **{N}** workers that run in parallel — each one walks its assigned files, wraps user-visible strings with the right macro, and adds short translator comments where context isn't obvious. After they all finish, a final verify worker {for JS/TS: `runs extract + compile + build, then a recall self-check that catches any user-facing string the first pass missed (data modules, helpers) and self-heals it, so nothing ships unwrapped`; for Rails: `checks that every wrapped key has a matching source-locale entry, tidies any leftover scaffold keys, and runs your test suite if you have one`; for Android: `checks every `strings.xml` is well-formed and that target locales cover the source keys (running Lint for `MissingTranslation` if the Android SDK is available)`; for Swift: `runs a catalog-integrity check — confirming the String Catalog is valid JSON and covers the keys your code uses (no extract/compile step; the build populates the catalog)`}."

### 3.1 Pre-create progress files

For each `wrap-N` subagent declared in `plan.md`, write `progress/wrap-N.json` with `status: "pending"` and the planned per-file step list. Write `progress/verify.json` with `status: "pending"` and verify plan.

### 3.2 Dispatch wrap subagents in parallel

Send all wrap subagents in **a single Agent tool message** so they launch in parallel. Each wrap subagent prompt includes:

> You are wrapping hardcoded UI strings with the project's i18n macros. Read `.globalize/decisions.md` and `.globalize/detection.json` for context. App domain: {decisions.appDomain}.
>
> Your assigned files (process in order; layout/shell first, then shared, then pages, then utilities):
> {numbered list from plan.md for this partition}
>
> Read these reference files for macro guidance: {paths from manifest-snapshot.references.convert}.
>
> For each file: identify translatable strings, wrap with the correct macro, add translator comments inline per the rules in the reference. (Paraglide is key-authored with no macro — instead of wrapping, author a descriptive, context-encoding key plus its catalog entry and replace the string with the `m.key()` call. **On the default PO catalog format**, author the entry into `messages/{baseLocale}.po` as `#.` comment + `msgid "key"` + `msgstr "ICU body"` — `.po` carries `#.` comments, so DO add them, following `references/languages/js-ts/frameworks/sveltekit/paraglide.convert.md`. **On the ICU-JSON catalog format** (`decisions.setup.catalogFormat === "json"`), the inlang/ICU JSON model has no translator-comment field, so do NOT add comments — descriptive key naming is the only disambiguation lever; follow `references/languages/js-ts/libraries/paraglide/json-format.convert.md` instead. **Android is also key-authored, with no macro and no automated extractor** — author a `<string name="key">value</string>` (or `<plurals>`) entry into `res/values/strings.xml`, then replace the literal with `getString(R.string.key)` / `resources.getQuantityString(R.plurals.key, count, count)` in Kotlin/Java, `stringResource(R.string.key)` / `pluralStringResource(...)` in Compose, or `@string/key` in XML layouts. Android XML **supports `<!-- -->` comments**, so DO add a short translator comment above non-obvious keys, plus `<xliff:g>` for do-not-translate runs; follow `references/languages/android/native/android-strings.convert.md`.) Update `.globalize/progress/wrap-N.json` after each file (atomic write). Do NOT run `extract` or `compile` — that runs once after all wrap subagents complete (Android has no extract/compile — the verify worker only validates).
>
> Ambiguity protocol and progress schema as in Phase 2.

### 3.3 Poll all wrap subagents

Wake every 30–60s, read all `wrap-N.json` files, update the user-visible todo list (per-file todos under each subagent group). Surface aggregated progress: "wrap-1: 3/8 files, wrap-2: 2/5 files, wrap-3: 4/4 ✓".

### 3.4 Wait for all wrap subagents to terminate

If any returns `needs_decision`, pause polling, surface to user, re-dispatch as in Phase 2.

If any returns `failed`, surface error. The verify subagent should still run on whatever files were successfully wrapped — don't block extraction on a single partition failure unless catastrophic.

### 3.5 Dispatch verify subagent (background)

> You are verifying the convert phase. Read `.globalize/decisions.md` for catalog format and locales. Read manifest snapshot for library.
>
> Plan steps depend on the library's catalog model:
> - **Compile-time extraction (Lingui)** and **runtime-catalog (next-intl/vue-i18n)**: extract_clean, compile, build_check, comment_review_pass.
> - **Compile-from-catalog (Paraglide)**: paraglide_compile, build_check. There is **no extract step** (keys are authored by hand, not extracted). On the **default PO** format `.po` carries `#.` comments, so a comment_review_pass over the base `.po` **does** apply, plus an ICU plural-render sanity check (see below). On the **ICU-JSON** format (`catalogFormat === "json"`) there is **no comment_review_pass** (the inlang/ICU JSON model has no translator-comment field).
> - **Runtime-catalog, no compile (Rails)**: ensure_i18n_tasks, source_completeness_check, unused_cleanup, optional test_suite. There is **no extract step** and **no compile step** (Rails loads `config/locales/*.yml` directly at runtime). The verify gate is **base-locale completeness**: confirm the source-locale YAML parses and that every key used in code has a base-locale entry (`i18n-tasks missing -t used` is empty). Target-locale gaps are expected (stubs deferred to the connect phase) and never fail the gate; orphaned keys are cleaned, not gated. There is **no normalize-drift gate** — the catalog is left in its authored reading order (canonical ordering is a CI / connect-time concern, see `setup.add-ons.md` Add-on 3).
> - **Runtime-catalog, no compile (Android)**: xml_validity_check, locale_coverage_check, optional lint_check. There is **no extract step** and **no compile step** (the platform loads `res/values*/strings.xml` at runtime). The verify gate is catalog integrity: confirm every `strings.xml` is well-formed XML and that each target `res/values-*/strings.xml` covers the source keys; **if the Android SDK is available**, run `./gradlew lint` and surface `MissingTranslation`/`ExtraTranslation`, otherwise skip lint without failing.
> - **Single multi-locale catalog, build-time populated (Swift / Apple)**: catalog_integrity_check (no extract/compile codemod step). The wrap subagents make strings localizable per `string-catalog.convert.md`; there is **no extract or compile codemod** — a normal Xcode build with `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS = YES` emits `.stringsdata` that populates `Localizable.xcstrings` (or, headless, `xcrun xcstringstool extract → sync` does the same). The verify gate is **catalog integrity**: the `.xcstrings` is valid JSON and covers the used keys (see the Swift arm below).
>
> For Lingui / next-intl / vue-i18n:
> 1. Run `npx lingui extract --clean` (Lingui) or `npx next-intl extract` if applicable. Capture errors. Atomically update `progress/verify.json` after this step.
> 2. Run `npx lingui compile` (with `--typescript` if TS). Capture errors.
> 3. Run the project's typecheck and build command. Capture pass/fail.
> 4. **Recall self-check (backstop for detection misses).** Following `references/languages/js-ts/convert.recall-self-check.md`, scan the full source root for user-facing strings that were never wrapped — Lingui: install + run `lingui/no-unlocalized-strings` (per Add-on 2; guided-mode consent before installing, unguided installs directly; declined → grep scan); next-intl: tuned grep scan; vue-i18n: `@intlify/eslint-plugin-vue-i18n` `no-raw-text` or grep. Write findings to `result.recallViolations`. If **empty**, continue to step 5. If **non-empty**, write `status: "needs_cleanup"` and stop — the orchestrator runs the cleanup loop (below), which self-heals via `wrap-cleanup` subagents (each re-catalogs and re-scans itself) until the recall scan is clean or the budget is hit; once it settles, resume at step 5.
> 5. Read the extracted catalog. For entries lacking translator comments where the heuristic in the reference says one should exist (single-/two-word phrases, action labels without object, domain-sensitive terms), edit the source file to add the missing comment.
>
> For Paraglide:
> 1. Run `npx '@inlang/paraglide-js@^2' compile --project ./project.inlang --outdir ./src/lib/paraglide` (both flags; single-quoted pin so zsh's `EXTENDED_GLOB` does not eat the caret). Capture errors. Atomically update `progress/verify.json` after this step.
> 2. Run the project's typecheck and build command. Capture pass/fail. (No extract step.) **Default PO format:** (a) inspect a compiled plural message (`src/lib/paraglide/messages/<key>.js`) to confirm it emits CLDR `registry.plural(...)` branches and **not** the raw `{count, plural, …}` source as a literal — raw source means `"messageFormat": "icu"` is missing or an `msgstr` is malformed (both fail silently); (b) run a comment-review pass over the base `messages/{baseLocale}.po`, adding `#.` comments where the reference's heuristic says one should exist. **ICU-JSON format (`catalogFormat === "json"`):** skip both — there is no comment field, and the ICU1 plugin already fails the build on malformed ICU.
> 3. **Recall self-check.** Paraglide has no official `no-unlocalized-strings` rule (see `paraglide/setup.add-ons.md`), so run the tuned grep scan from `references/languages/js-ts/convert.recall-self-check.md` over `src/` (adapted to `.svelte` templates). Write `result.recallViolations`; on non-empty, `status: "needs_cleanup"` and let the orchestrator run the cleanup loop (the cleanup subagent authors the missing `m.key()` entries per the Paraglide convert reference).
>
> For Rails:
> 0. **Ensure `i18n-tasks` is installed (this phase owns the install).** If `i18n-tasks` is not in `Gemfile.lock`, add `gem "i18n-tasks", "~> 1.0"` to the `:development, :test` group, run `bundle install`, and scaffold `config/i18n-tasks.yml` if absent (per `rails.convert.md` Step 4). If `bundle install` fails, record the error, mark the gate **skipped** (not failed), and continue — do not block the run on missing audit tooling. (Rails installs gems inside subagents; Phase 2.0 is a no-op for bundler.)
> 1. **Base-locale completeness gate:** run `bundle exec i18n-tasks missing -t used` — the keys used in code that have no entry in the base locale. The gate **passes** when this reports **no keys** (every wrapped key has a source entry). **Judge by the reported keys, not the process exit code:** `i18n-tasks missing` is a report command and may exit `0` even with findings (only `i18n-tasks health` is contracted to exit non-zero for CI). Inspect the output — any base-locale key listed under `-t used` is a gate failure; for a machine-checkable form, `bundle exec i18n-tasks missing -t used -f keys` prints one key per line and an empty result means pass. Capture pass/fail. Atomically update `progress/verify.json` after this step. Do **not** run `i18n-tasks health` — its all-locale `missing` + `unused` would false-fail on the empty target stubs and on setup seed keys (both by design). Target-locale gaps (`bundle exec i18n-tasks missing -t diff`) are expected — report them as informational, never as a failure. (Confirm the exact `-t used` flag with `bundle exec i18n-tasks missing --help` if the gem version differs.) There is **no extract step** and **no compile step** — Rails loads `config/locales/*.yml` directly at runtime.
> 2. **Unused cleanup (not a gate):** run `bundle exec i18n-tasks unused` and delete genuinely-orphaned scaffold seed keys (e.g. the `site.title` seed the setup phase added that the app never references) from the source catalog, so the shipped catalog — and the later CI `i18n-tasks health` gate — stays clean. This is a cleanup action, not a pass/fail gate. Do **not** run `i18n-tasks normalize` here: leave the catalog in its authored reading order (canonical ordering is handled by CI Add-on 3). Confirm the catalogs parse and cover every configured locale.
> 3. **If a test suite is present** (`spec/` with RSpec, or `test/` for Minitest): run it. With `config.i18n.raise_on_missing_translations = true` set in `config/environments/test.rb` (configured by the setup phase), any missing key raises immediately, so a green suite confirms catalog coverage. Capture pass/fail. If no suite is present, skip this step.
>
> For Swift / Apple:
> 1. **Catalog-integrity gate (no extract/compile codemod step).** The wrap subagents already made strings localizable per `string-catalog.convert.md`; there is no separate extract or compile codemod (build-time `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS = YES` / `xcstringstool` populates the catalog). Run the headless three-step form (NOT a pipe) to confirm the catalog is valid and covers the used keys:
>    ```
>    DIR=$(mktemp -d)
>    xcrun xcstringstool extract <sources> --SwiftUI --modern-localizable-strings [--legacy-localizable-strings] --output-directory "$DIR"
>    xcrun xcstringstool sync <catalog> --stringsdata "$DIR"/*.stringsdata
>    xcrun xcstringstool print <catalog>
>    ```
>    Capture pass/fail. Atomically update `progress/verify.json` after this step. **Graceful degradation:** if `xcrun xcstringstool` is absent (no Xcode toolchain), author + static-JSON-validate the catalog instead (parse the `.xcstrings` as JSON; check `sourceLanguage`, `strings`, `version`) and mark build-verify **deferred** (NOT failed) — a later macOS build / `xcstringstool` run populates it. Authoritative commands: `references/languages/ios/native/string-catalog.convert.md`.
>
> Authoritative commands: `references/languages/ruby/frameworks/rails/rails.convert.md` Steps 4-5 and `references/languages/ruby/frameworks/rails/setup.add-ons.md` Add-on 3.
>
> For Android:
> 1. **XML validity** — parse every `res/values/strings.xml` and `res/values-*/strings.xml`; any malformed file (unescaped `&`/`'`, broken tag) is a failure. Capture pass/fail. Atomically update `progress/verify.json` after this step. (There is **no extract step** and **no compile step** — the platform loads resources at runtime.)
> 2. **Locale coverage** — for each configured target locale, confirm `res/values-<qualifier>/strings.xml` exists and defines every `name` present in the source `res/values/strings.xml` (including each `<plurals>` group). Report any missing keys. Also confirm a `comment_review_pass` over the source `strings.xml`, adding `<!-- -->` translator comments and `<xliff:g>` annotations where the reference's heuristic says one should exist (Android XML carries comments — they DO apply, unlike Paraglide ICU-JSON).
> 3. **Lint (if the Android SDK is available)** — run `./gradlew lint` and capture `MissingTranslation` / `ExtraTranslation`; this is the authoritative coverage gate when the toolchain is present. **If the SDK/Gradle is absent, skip this step and do not fail** — record `lint: "skipped: no Android SDK"` and rely on steps 1-2.
>
> Authoritative commands: `references/languages/android/native/android-strings.convert.md` (verify section) and `references/languages/android/native/setup.add-ons.md` (CI/lint add-on).
>
> Write `result` with `{ catalogPath, totalMessages, extractOk, compileOk, buildOk, commentsAdded, recallViolations, cleanupRounds, stringsWrappedInCleanup, residualViolations }` — the last four are the recall self-check fields (`recallViolations`: `[{file,line,text}]` from the scan; `cleanupRounds`: how many cleanup rounds ran; `stringsWrappedInCleanup`: total strings the cleanup subagents wrapped; `residualViolations`: any left when the loop stopped, reported to the user). For libraries with no recall scan run (Rails/Android/Swift this pass), set all four to `null`. For Paraglide, set `extractOk` to `null`; set `commentsAdded` to the count added on the default PO format and to `null` on ICU-JSON; report compile success under `compileOk`. For Rails, set `extractOk` to `null` (no extraction — keys are hand-authored in YAML); report the base-locale completeness result (`i18n-tasks missing -t used` empty) under `compileOk` (Rails' catalog-integrity gate stands in for compile; a gate skipped because `bundle install` failed reports as `null` with the error noted in `errors`); set `buildOk` to the test-suite result when a suite ran, else `null` (Rails has no build step); set `commentsAdded` to `null`. For Rails, `catalogPath` is `config/locales/{default_locale}.yml` and `totalMessages` is the key count in that file (Rails has no extraction step to count from). For Android, set `extractOk` to `null` (no extraction — keys are hand-authored in XML); report the combined XML-validity + locale-coverage result under `compileOk` (Android's catalog-integrity gate stands in for compile); set `buildOk` to the `./gradlew lint` result when it ran, else `null` (lint skipped / no SDK); set `commentsAdded` to the count of `<!-- -->` comments added (Android XML carries comments). For Android, `catalogPath` is `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and `totalMessages` is the `<string>` + `<plurals>` count in that file. For Swift, set `extractOk` to `null` (no extraction codemod — keys land via build-time `SWIFT_EMIT_LOC_STRINGS`/`xcstringstool`); report the catalog-integrity result under `compileOk` (and `null` with build-verify-deferred noted in `errors` when `xcstringstool` is absent and only static-JSON-validate ran); set `buildOk` to `null` (no JS build step); set `commentsAdded` to `null`. For Swift, `catalogPath` is the `.xcstrings` (e.g. `Localizable.xcstrings`) and `totalMessages` is the key count in `strings`.

#### 3.5.1 Cleanup loop (JS/TS recall backstop)

If the verify subagent returns `status: "needs_cleanup"` with `result.recallViolations`, the orchestrator self-heals the missed strings — this is the backstop for any `candidateFiles` detection miss (data modules, toast/error helpers, config copy). Drive it per `references/languages/js-ts/convert.recall-self-check.md`:

For up to `maxCleanupRounds` (default **2**) rounds:
1. Collect the distinct files in `recallViolations`. If more than **40**, cap to the 40 highest-violation files and surface how many were dropped (no silent truncation).
2. Dispatch a **`wrap-cleanup` subagent** (background, same dispatch pattern as Phase 3.2) whose prompt mirrors the Phase 3.2 wrap prompt — same `manifest-snapshot.references.convert` + `references.code` — with the file list = the violating files and the "these files were MISSED by detection; wrap per `code.md`, apply the skip-list, leave genuine non-translatables" note from the recall reference. Pre-create `progress/wrap-cleanup-{round}.json`.
3. Before returning, the `wrap-cleanup` subagent itself re-runs the library's catalog step (Lingui: `lingui extract --clean` + `compile`; Paraglide: `paraglide compile`; next-intl/vue-i18n: none — runtime catalogs) and the recall scan, writing its round's residual `recallViolations` and the count it wrapped to `progress/wrap-cleanup-{round}.json` (per the reference — there is no separate verify re-dispatch). The orchestrator reads that residual and aggregates the per-round counts into the verify `result`.
4. Stop when: the scan is clean; **or** a round wrapped zero new strings (`stringsWrappedInCleanup === 0`); **or** the round budget is reached. Report any `residualViolations` to the user with file+line (never drop silently).

Record `result.cleanupRounds` and surface a one-line summary: "Self-heal wrapped **{stringsWrappedInCleanup}** strings that detection missed{, N left for manual review if residual}." Then proceed to `comment_review_pass` and 3.6.

Rails/Android/Swift do not run this loop this pass — their verify gates (`i18n-tasks missing -t used`, `./gradlew lint`, catalog integrity) already report coverage; extending the loop to them (`erb_lint`, `gradlew` `HardcodedText`, grep) is a follow-up.

### 3.6 Cost estimate (Phase 3 → 4 bridge)

After verify succeeds, parse the extracted catalog (JS) / the source-locale YAML (Rails) / the source `res/values/strings.xml` (Android) to compute word count. Show the user:

> "Phase 3 complete. Catalog: **{totalMessages}** messages, ~**{wordCount}** words. Translating into **{N}** target locales (`{targets}`) would cost roughly **~${estimate}** on Globalize.now."

When `result.stringsWrappedInCleanup > 0` (the 3.5.1 recall cleanup loop ran), prepend the recall self-heal summary to this message: "Self-heal wrapped **{stringsWrappedInCleanup}** strings that detection missed{, N left for manual review if residual}."

If `decisions.scope.globalize === true`, advance to Phase 4 with:

> "Moving on to Phase 4 — creating your Globalize project and connecting the repo. You're already signed in from earlier, so this is mostly automated (one quick browser approval to authorize the GitHub/GitLab app)."

Otherwise (the user unchecked Globalize at 1.6), end with:

> "Skipping the translation-platform step for now. Re-run `globalize-guide` with `connect translation platform` checked when you're ready to wire it up."

### Phase 3 collapse-cases

- `existing.stringsWrapped === "yes"` → skip wrap subagents; run only verify.
- `existing.stringsWrapped === "partial"` → Phase 1 candidate list already excluded already-wrapped files.

---

## Phase 4 — Globalize project (connect repo + patterns)

The gate already passed: Globalize is in scope and the user signed in back in Phase 1.5. This stage creates the project and connects the repo by **delegating to `globalize-now-project-setup`** on the main thread — the orchestrator assembles the inputs and invokes the skill; it does **not** inline Globalize CLI commands.

> **User-facing message** (at Phase 4 start):
> "Phase 4 — creating your Globalize project and connecting your repo. You're already signed in, so I just hand the project details and your finished catalog paths to the project-setup skill. One quick browser approval authorizes Globalize's GitHub/GitLab app, then it creates the project, connects the repo, and wires the catalog file patterns."

### 4.1 Assemble `.globalize/globalize-inputs.json`

Build the inputs bundle the project skill consumes, from data already on hand — no re-detection:

- **projectName**, **provider**, **sourceLocale**, **targetLocales** ← `decisions.md` (collected in 1.7 / 1.9).
- **owner**, **repo**, **gitUrl** ← `detection.json` `git.remote` (parse owner/repo; convert SSH → HTTPS for `--git-url`).
- **catalogPath** ← Phase 3 verify `result.catalogPath`.
- **localePathPattern** + **fileFormat** ← derive from the library (the one piece of Globalize knowledge the orchestrator still owns, because it depends on the just-converted catalog):
  - **Lingui** → `po`, e.g. `src/locales/{locale}/messages.po`.
  - **next-intl** → `json-nested`, e.g. `messages/{locale}.json`.
  - **Paraglide** → `po` at `messages/{locale}.po` by default; if `decisions.setup.catalogFormat === "json"`, `json-flat` at `messages/{locale}.json`.
  - **Rails** (`detection.language === "ruby"`, `framework === "rails"`) → `yaml-rails` at `config/locales/{locale}.yml`; source = detected `default_locale` (or `en`). Rails locale codes are already hyphenated (`pt-BR`, `zh-TW`) — pass through verbatim, no underscore normalization.
  - **Android** (`detection.language === "android"`) → `android-strings`; **no `{locale}` segment** — point `localePathPattern` at the source `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and let the handler discover the `values-*` target overlays (it normalizes legacy `values-pt-rBR` and BCP47 `values-b+sr+Latn` ⇄ BCP47). Do not synthesize a `{locale}` token.
  - **Swift / Apple** (`detection.language === "swift"`) → `xcstrings`; **single file, no `{locale}` segment** — `Localizable.xcstrings` (or `**/*.xcstrings` for multiple tables). The catalog holds every locale; source = the catalog's `sourceLanguage` / `CFBundleDevelopmentRegion`.
- **importMode**: `"ignore"`, **importScope**: `"new_keys_only"`, **mode**: `"orchestrated"`.

Write the file to `.globalize/globalize-inputs.json` and mark `assemble_globalize_inputs` done in `plan.md`.

### 4.2 Re-check auth

The account skill ran in Phase 1.5, but the token may be absent (user skipped sign-in) or expired. Delegate a quick `auth status` check. If **not** authenticated, invoke `globalize-now-account-setup` now (main thread) before proceeding; if authenticated, continue.

### 4.3 Delegate to `globalize-now-project-setup` (main thread)

Invoke the **`globalize-now-project-setup`** skill via the Skill tool, in **orchestrated mode**:

> "Orchestrated mode. Read `.globalize/globalize-inputs.json` for all inputs; skip detection and the Setup Mode prompt; run unguided. Connect the git provider (one browser approval if the GitHub App / GitLab OAuth isn't installed yet), create the project, connect the repo, and set the catalog patterns from the supplied `localePathPattern` + `fileFormat`."

The skill owns the entire CLI surface (auth precheck, `projects create`, provider connect, `repositories create`, etc.). The interactive GitHub-App / GitLab-OAuth approval happens here — the project skill front-loads it before the create/connect work. Mark `delegate_project_setup` done in `plan.md` when it returns.

**If `globalize-now-project-setup` is not installed**, the Skill invocation fails — tell the user to run `npx skills add globalize-now/globalize-skills --skill globalize-now-project-setup` and re-invoke. (The standard install co-installs all the Globalize skills.)

### 4.4 Surface and finish

Show the project URL and a one-line summary:

> "All set. Project created: **{projectUrl}**. Repo connected, catalog patterns wired. From here on, use the `globalize-now-cli-use` skill (or the `globalize` CLI directly) for ongoing translation work — pulling translations, tracking status, requesting new languages."

## Reading the reference files (subagents)

Reference files under `references/languages/.../*.md` walk through their variant's setup or convert work linearly via section headings (e.g., "Packages", "Build Tool Integration", "Provider Setup", "Language Switcher"). Follow them in document order — section headings are the authoritative ordering, not the orchestrator's plan step IDs (those are higher-level phase markers used by the polling loop).

Some references include catalog-format sub-references for an **alternate** format (e.g., `references/languages/js-ts/libraries/next-intl/po-format.setup.md`, and for Paraglide `references/languages/js-ts/libraries/paraglide/json-format.{setup,convert,code}.md`). When the user is on the alternate format, substitute that reference's snippets in place of the default examples — the variant reference itself flags the substitution points. For Paraglide specifically: the **default is PO**, so the base files (`frameworks/sveltekit/paraglide.{setup,convert}.md` and `libraries/paraglide/code.md`) are the PO path and apply as-is. Only when `decisions.setup.catalogFormat === "json"` does the setup subagent apply `json-format.setup.md` over `paraglide.setup.md`, the wrap subagents apply `json-format.convert.md` over `paraglide.convert.md`, and the coding-rules add-on install `json-format.code.md` instead of `code.md` (see the add-ons reference).

If a reference's instructions appear to require user input that wasn't collected in Phase 1, do not improvise: write `status: "needs_decision"` to your progress file and exit so the orchestrator can ask.

## Subagent dispatch mechanics

- Use the Agent tool with `run_in_background: true` for all phase subagents (Phase 2 setup, Phase 3 wrap and verify). The orchestrator polls progress files instead of waiting on the subagent's terminal output.
- For Phase 1.1 (inspect), foreground (blocking) is fine — the subagent only writes one JSON file and returns.
- **Phase 1.5 (account) and Phase 4 (project) are not subagents.** They run on the main thread by delegating to the `globalize-now-account-setup` / `globalize-now-project-setup` skills via the Skill tool (interactive sign-in and repo-connection browser steps need the main thread). No background dispatch, no `progress/*.json` polling for these two.
- All wrap subagents in Phase 3 must be dispatched **in a single tool-use message** to launch in parallel.
- Subagents must use atomic file writes (write `<file>.tmp`, then `mv`) when updating progress files.
- Each subagent reads the same set of inputs from `.globalize/`: it does not need orchestrator-side state passed via prompt beyond pointers to those files.

---

## Edge cases

- **Multiple frameworks detected** (e.g., both `next` and `vite` in deps): Next.js takes precedence — use Rule 1 in 1.5.
- **Monorepo**: Detect from the closest `package.json` to the working directory. Do not aggregate deps across workspace packages.
- **User overrides recommendation** with a library that doesn't match a manifest entry: surface the supported list and ask them to pick one of those.
- **`.globalize/` already exists from a prior run**: see Resumability section above.
- **No `git` repo**: skip 1.4 (branch recommendation) silently.
- **`decisions.md` is hand-edited between runs**: re-validate against `manifest-snapshot.json` before re-dispatching subagents — fail loudly if invalid.
